== Development

=== Viewing Pages with AsciiDoctor

If you are not using an IDE plugin,
you can convert your AsciiDoc files with AsciiDoctor.
On Linux, you can install AsciiDoctor
from your distro's package manager.

You use AsciiDoctor from the command line like this:
[code,bash]
----
asciidoctor <file>
----

AsciiDoctor will output an HTML file
in the same directory as your input file,
which you can open in your browser.
